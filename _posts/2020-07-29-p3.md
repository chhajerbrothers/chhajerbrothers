<center><h3>What is Google Developer Student Club (DSC)?</h3></center>

I would simply put this as verbatim from Google's site, *‘‘Developer Student Clubs are university-based community groups for students interested in Google developer technologies. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a DSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and their community.’’*

Here is a short video presentation by Erica Hanson who is a Global Program Lead for Google Developer Students Clubs worldwide explaining what the program is about.
